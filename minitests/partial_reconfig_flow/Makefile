# Top-level target for generating a programmable bitstream.  Given a .fasm
# file, calling make with the .fasm extension replaced with _hand_crafted.bit
# will generate a bitstream that includes both the harness and the .fasm design
# ready for programming to a board.  For example,
# 'make inv_hand_crafted.bit' will generate a bitstream that includes the
# design from roi_noninv.fasm.
