The main goal of the X-Ray Project is to provide information
about Xilinx 7-Series FPGA internals. All obtained chip data is stored in
the project's database and is used by `Architecture Definitions`_ project
to prepare bitstream for the chosen 7-Series FPGA chip.

The database is generated by the fuzzers and is located in the ``database``
directory. Each supported chip architecture has its own set of files, they
are located in ``database/<device_arch>/``. Although the database
is huge it consists only of a few file types. Some of them are common
for whole 7-Series architecture, but some of them are part-specific.

.. _Architecture Definitions: https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs

Files common for whole 7-Series family:

   - ``mask_*``
   - ``ppips_*``
   - ``segbits_*``
   - ``site_type_*``
   - ``tile_type_*``
   - ``timings/*``

Some files are specific to a given part and are located in a separate directory.
The directory is named from the FPGA part name i.e *xc7a35tcpg236-1* or *xc7a50tfgg484-1*.

Files specific for the particular FPGA part:

   - ``package_pins.csv``
   - ``part.json``
   - ``part.yaml``
   - ``tileconn.json``
   - ``tilegrid.json``
